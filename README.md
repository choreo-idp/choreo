## What is Open Source Choreo?
Open Source Choreo is a fully open source Internal Developer Platform (IDP) designed to empower platform engineers by simplifying infrastructure automation, governance, and security. 

With Open Source Choreo, platform engineers can seamlessly setup the foundational components of the organization's IDP effortlessly. With automated CI/CD, security, and cloud tool integrations, Open Source Choreo helps platform teams enforce best practices and streamline development workflows.

At the same time, Open Source Choreo provides developers with a configured platform to build, test, and deploy applications without the complexity of managing infrastructure or foundational enterprise platform artifacts. 

What sets Open Source Choreo apart is its full customizability‚Äîorganizations have complete control over deployment, configurations, and extensions, enabling them to adapt the platform to their unique needs. By embracing platform engineering principles, Open Source Choreo enables teams to accelerate software delivery, optimize operations, and free up engineering resources‚Äîallowing them to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.

##  Open Source Choreo Abstractions 

Open Source Choreo converts typical enterprise abstractions into Kubernetes [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/), allowing platform engineers to set up the IDP and developers to manage application artifacts declaratively. This [document](docs/choreo-abstractions.md) outlines the abstractions used in Open Source Choreo
with references on how to define projects, components, builds, and deployments, ensuring consistency, scalability, and repeatability across environments.

## Quick Start Guide

Setting up Open Source Choreo in a Kubernetes cluster involves multiple steps and tools. This guide provides a fast and simple way to install a fully functional Open Source Choreo instance on your local machine with minimal prerequisites and effort by using a pre-configured dev container. 
This dev container has all the necessary tools installed for setting up Open Source Choreo and is ready to be used. Once the installation is complete, you can explore the underlying setup to understand how it works.
When you're done, you can fully clean up the setup, leaving your machine clutter-free.

#### Prerequisites
The only requirement is Docker ‚Äî just have it installed on your machine, and you're good to go. We recommend using [docker engine version 26.0+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.0/).

#### Start the Dev Container

Run the following command to start the dev container and launch a terminal session within it:

```shell
docker run --rm -it --name choreo-quick-idp \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v choreo-state:/state \
-v tf-state:/app/terraform \
--network bridge \
-p 8443:8443 \
ghcr.io/choreo-idp/quick-start:latest

```

#### Install Open Source Choreo
This process sets up a [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (Kubernetes-in-Docker) cluster in your Docker environment and installs Open Source Choreo along with its dependencies.

To begin the installation, run:

```shell
./install.sh
```

Once the installation is complete, you will see the following confirmation message:
```text
>>>> Everything has been setup, ready to deploy application.
``` 

#### Deploying a Web Application with Open Source Choreo

You now have Open Source Choreo fully setup in your docker environment. 
Next, lets deploy a sample Web Application by running the following command:

```shell
./deploy_web_application.sh
```

Once the deployment is complete, you will receive the following message together with a URL to access the application:

```text
‚úÖ Endpoint is ready!
üåç You can now access the Sample Web Application at: https://react-starter-image-development.choreo.localhost:8443
```

### Understanding What Happens Behind the Scenes
By following the install and deploy web application commands, you first, setup Open Source Choreo and then, successfully deployed and accessed a fully functional Web Application. 

Let‚Äôs now explore what happened after each command. To access the artifacts created in Open Source Choreo we will be using choreoctl.

#### 1. The Install command
- A dev container with all the necessary tools for Open Source Choreo to run in a local Docker environment.
- A KinD Kubernetes cluster, where the Open Source Choreo IDP and its dependencies were installed using Helm charts.

To check all the installed components, run:
```shell
./check-status.sh
```

#### Foundation Resources Created by Open Source Choreo

The installation process, by default, sets up several essential abstractions. These are:
- Organization 
- Dataplane
- Environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production)
- A Deployment Pipeline for the environments, and a
- Default Project

You can inspect these in more detail using the following commands:

```shell
choreoctl get organizations --organization default-org

choreoctl get dataplanes --organization default-org

choreoctl get environments --organization default-org

choreoctl get projects --organization default-org
```

#### 2. The Deploy Web Application Command
The deploy script creates a sample Web Application component, along with a Deployment for the sample web application.

To inspect these resources in more detail, run the following commands:

```shell
choreoctl get components --organization default-org --project default-project

choreoctl get deployment --organization default-org --project default-project --component react-starter-image --environment development
```

Open Source Choreo generates a Deployable Artifact and an Endpoint to access the running application:

```shell
choreoctl get deployableartifact --organization default-org --project default-project --component react-starter-image

choreoctl get endpoint --organization default-org --project default-project --component react-starter-image --environment development
```

### Cleaning up
To remove all resources and clean up the environment, run:

```shell
./uninstall.sh
```

Then exit the dev container by running:

```shell
exit
```

To clean up your Docker environment, run:

```shell
docker volume rm choreo-state tf-state
```

That's it! 

Now you understand how  Open Source Choreo simplifies the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.
