# OpenChoreo Installation

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and set up OpenChoreo on a Kubernetes cluster.

It begins with creating a compatible Kubernetes cluster with Cilium installed, followed by installing OpenChoreo using Helm and verifying the installation. Next, it covers installing the choreoctl CLI tool, which is required to manage OpenChoreo.

Additionally, the guide provides options to expose the OpenChoreo external gateway service to your host machine, enabling seamless access to the components you create.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional OpenChoreo deployment running on your Kubernetes cluster.


## Create Compatible Kubernetes Cluster

Compatible kubernetes cluster should have cilium installed.

If you don't have a compatible kubernetes cluster, you can create one of following in your local machine and start testing.

### Kind

In this section, you'll learn how to set up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster and install Cilium into that for making it compatible with OpenChoreo.

#### _Prerequisites_

1. Make sure you have installed [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation), version v0.25.0+.
   To verify the installation:
    ```shell
    kind version
    ```

2. Make sure you have installed [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), version v3.15+.
   To verify the installation:

    ```shell
    helm version
    ```
3. Make sure you have installed [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), version v1.23.5.
   To verify the installation:

    ```shell
    kubectl version --client
    ```

#### Steps for creating the kind cluster

Run the following command to create your kind cluster with the configurations provided in our [kind config](../install/kind/kind-config.yaml) file.

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/main/install/kind/kind-config.yaml | kind create cluster --config=-
```

#### Install Cilium

You can easily install Cilium into your cluster using the helm chart provided by us. This chart installs Cilium with minimal configurations required for OpenChoreo.
Run the following command to install Cilium:
```shell
helm install cilium oci://ghcr.io/choreo-idp/helm-charts/cilium  --version 0.1.0 --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m
```

## Install OpenChoreo

You can install OpenChoreo on any Kubernetes cluster that has Cilium installed. The main installation method of OpenChoreo is by using the Helm charts provided by us.


1. Install OpenChoreo using Helm

Use the following helm command to install OpenChoreo into your cluster.

```shell
helm install choreo oci://ghcr.io/choreo-idp/helm-charts/choreo \
--version 0.1.0 --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m
```

2. Verifying the Installation

We already provided a [script](../install/check-status.sh) to verify the installation status.

Run the following command to verify the installation status:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/main/install/check-status.sh | bash
```

Once you are done with the installation, you can try out our [samples](../samples) to get a better understanding of OpenChoreo.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to "Exposing the OpenChoreo Gateway" section to learn how to access the components you create in OpenChoreo via the external gateway.


## Install the choreoctl

[//]: # (TODO: Refine this once we properly release the CLI as a binary.)

`choreoctl` is the command-line interface for OpenChoreo. With that, you can seamlessly interact with OpenChoreo and manage your resources.

### _Prerequisites_

1. Make sure you have installed [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install), version 1.23.5.
2. Make sure to clone the repository into your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/choreo-idp/choreo.git
   ```


### Step 1 - Build `choreoctl`
From the root level of the repo, run:

```shell
make choreoctl-release
```

Once this is completed, it will have a `dist` directory created in the project root directory.

### Step 2 - Install `choreoctl` into your host machine

Run the following command to install the `choreoctl` CLI into your host machine.

```shell
./dist/choreoctl/choreoctl-install.sh
````

To verify the installation, run:

```shell
choreoctl
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Welcome to Choreo CLI, the command-line interface for Open Source Internal Developer Platform

Usage:
  choreoctl [command]

Available Commands:
  apply       Apply Choreo resource configurations
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  config      Manage Choreo configuration contexts
  create      Create Choreo resources
  get         Get Choreo resources
  help        Help about any command
  logs        Get Choreo resource logs

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for choreoctl

Use "choreoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Now `choreoctl` is all setup.

### Uninstall choreoctl

If you want to uninstall `choreoctl` from your host machine, you can use the [script](../install/choreoctl-uninstall.sh) that we have provided.

Run the following command to uninstall `choreoctl`:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/refs/heads/main/install/choreoctl-uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Exposing the OpenChoreo Gateway

To fully experience the end-to-end functionality of the OpenChoreo components you create, it's essential to expose the OpenChoreo external gateway service to your host machine. This ensures seamless access to your deployed components.

### Kind

In this section, we will guide you on how to expose the OpenChoreo external gateway service to your host machine in a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster.

Once you successfully [installed OpenChoreo](#install-openchoreo) into your cluster, you will see a LoadBalancer service created for our external gateway.

You can see the service using the following command.

```shell
kubectl get svc choreo-external-gateway -n choreo-system
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```text
NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
choreo-external-gateway   LoadBalancer   10.96.75.106   <pending>     443:30807/TCP   55m
```

You have two options to expose the choreo-external-gateway service to your host machine.

1. Option 1: Use [cloud-provider-kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind/tree/main) to expose the service.
2. Option 2: port-forward from your host machine to choreo-external-gateway service.

##### Option 1: Use _cloud-provider-kind_ to expose the service.

The following steps will guide you through using the [cloud-provider-kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind/tree/main) tool for exposing the external-gateway service.

First, [install](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#install) the cloud-provider-kind tool to your host machine.

Then, run this tool in sudo mode, and it will automatically assign LoadBalancer IP to your choreo-external-gateway service.

```shell
# run this command in a separate terminal and keep it running.
sudo $(which cloud-provider-kind)
```

Then you could find the load balancer IP for your external-gateway service as follows.

```shell
kubectl get svc -n choreo-system | grep choreo-external-gateway
```

```shell
# to find the LoadBalancer-IP
# <name> should be replaced with the service name found in the previous step.
$ kubectl get svc/<name> -n choreo-system -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

Then you can use this IP address to access the components you create in OpenChoreo via the external gateway.

##### Option 2: Port-forward the external-gateway service

Run the following command to do port-forwarding from your host machine to the `choreo-external-gateway` service.

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/choreo-external-gateway -n choreo-system 443:443
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have an existing service listening on port 443, or any permission issues, you may encounter issues when attempting port forwarding. To avoid conflicts, consider changing the port as needed.
> Ex: `kubectl port-forward svc/choreo-external-gateway -n choreo-system 8443:443`

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to add entries to `/etc/hosts` to access components through the external gateway, as it relies on the hostname for request routing.
> For example, if your endpoint URL is `https://default-org-default-project-hello-world-ea384b50-development.choreo.localhost`, and your load balancer IP is `172.19.0.4` you need to add the following entry to your /etc/hosts file.
> `172.19.0.4 default-org-default-project-hello-world-ea384b50-development.choreoapps.localhost`
