## Design Considerations

When designing the resource kinds for Choreo v3, several principles have been followed to ensure the consistency between resource kinds. These considerations help to keep a clear mapping of Choreo concepts to resource kinds while maintaining the simplicity of the resource model.

- Each concept in Choreo will have a corresponding resource kind. This one-to-one mapping will ensures that the users can easily understand the resource model.
- In situations where a resource kind is required but does not directly correspond to a core Choreo concept, the following will apply:
    - If two resource kinds share a one-to-one relationship, they will be combined into a single resource kind.
    - If combining them introduces implementation complexity or if it makes logical sense to keep them distinct, keep them as separate resource kinds. For example,
        - Implementation complexity: A resource kinds with many fields may cause the controller to perform many operations, leading to processing delays for that resource kind.
        - Logical sense: `Deployment` and `DeploymentRevision` are kept as separate resource kinds. For example, `Deployment` and `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` in Kubernetes.
    - For resource kinds with a one-to-many relationship, the child resources can be embedded within the parent resource kind with `<KindName>TemplateSpec` to define the specifications of the child resources to reduce the number of resource kinds.

## Kubernetes Metadata Representation

To represent the Choreo hierarchical resource model in Kubernetes, the following rules will be followed:

1. The Organization will be represented as a Cluster-wide CRD that will mapped to a Kubernetes Namespace.
2. The resources within an organization (e.g., Components, Projects, Environments, DataPlanes) will be represented as a Namespaced resources in Kubernetes.
3. The relationships between namespaced resources will be represented using Kubernetes labels.
4. Any other metadata will be represented as annotations in the Kubernetes resources (e.g., Display Name, Description).

### Labels Based Relationships

The following labels format will be used to represent the relationships between the resources:

`core.choreo.dev/<kind-lowecase>=<resource-name>`

Examples:
- `core.choreo.dev/organization=my-org`: The organization name that the resource belongs to.
- `core.choreo.dev/project=my-project`: The project name that the resource belongs to.

In addition to the above labels, the following label will be used to represent the name of the resource:

`core.choreo.dev/name=<resource-name>`

The reason for using having additional label for the resource name is to keep the Choreo hierarchical naming without conflicting with the Kubernetes resource name.
This will allow duplicate resource names within the same namespace such as having two components with the same name in different projects.

## Resource Kinds

The following sections describe each resource kind in detail and provide information about the fields and relationships of each resource kind.

### DataPlane

The `DataPlane` resource kind represents a Private Data Plane in Choreo. The controller of this resource kind is responsible for keeping the health status of the data plane. All other resources kinds will refer to this resource
to get the data plane information.

The `DeploymentTrack` resource kind represents a deployment path for a component in Choreo that manages the deployment of the component across environments.

The deployment track will be responsible for following actions:

- Manage the auto deployment of the component to the first environment in the deployment pipeline based on a given trigger (e.g., successful build, edit to the deployable artifact).
- Managing number of Build resources that are created for the deployment track.

### Deployment

The `Deployment` resource kind represents a deployment in an environment that is bound to a deployment track.
For a given deployment track and environment, only one deployment resource can be available at a time.

The deployment controller will be responsible for the following actions:

- Manage the deployment revisions based on the deployment configuration to track the deployment history.
- Deploy the deployable artifact to the environment and merge any configuration overrides if provided.
- Monitor the deployment status and update the deployment status accordingly.
- Ensure the initial resource are created in the environment before deploying. (e.g., Namespace, NetworkPolicies, etc.)

**Field Reference:**

```yaml

### DeploymentRevision

The `DeploymentRevision` resource kind represents a snapshot of the deployment resource at a given time. This resource is created by the deployment controller to track the deployment history upon each spec change.
During the revert operation, the deployment controller will use the deployment revision to restore the spec of the deployment.

**Field Reference:**

```yaml

### ConfigurationGroup

The `ConfigurationGroup` resource kind represents configuration groupings and mappings for an organization across its environments. `ConfigurationGroups` include both configs which are not senstive as well as secrets which are sensitive. 
This resource is created manually for an organization by the user and its values are referred to in the  `DeployableArtifact` resource kind.

**Field Reference:**

The system secrets has predefined key-value pairs that are used by the system components.
