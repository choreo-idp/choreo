# Introduction
This folder contains sample configurations for setting up Choreo platform resources. These are Choreo abstractions that help you configure foundational elements like data planes, environments, and projects.

For more detailed information about these resources, refer to the [Official Choreo Documentation](https://github.com/choreo-idp/choreo/tree/main/docs).

## Default Resources
When you set up Choreo, default resources are automatically created. However, if you wish to experiment with custom configurations or explore advanced use cases, the samples in this folder are designed to help you do just that.
