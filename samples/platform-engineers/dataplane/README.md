# Create a new DataPlane
This sample demonstrates how to create a new dataPlane in Choreo.
Please note that this is currently for reference purposes only. At the moment, Choreo does not support adding external data planes, 
but this feature is on the roadmap for future releases.

## Deploy in Choreo
Use the following command to create the new dataPlane.

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/platform-engineers/dataplane/dataplane.yaml
``` 

```bash
dataplane.core.choreo.dev/us-east-1 created
```
