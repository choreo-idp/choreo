# Book Store Sample with Organization-Level Service Visibility

This sample demonstrates how to deploy two interconnected applications in Choreo: a backend service and a web application. The frontend communicates with the backend service internally.

Choreo enables this communication through organization-level visibility, allowing seamless interaction between internal services.

## What does this sample do?

This sample deploys:

1. A Reading List Service (backend) in the "default-project"
2. A Reading List Web Application (frontend) in the "portal" project
3. Configures organization-level visibility to enable secure communication between the applications within the cluster

## Architecture overview

- **Reading List Service**: A backend service that manages the reading list data
- **Reading List Web App**: A server-side rendered (SSR) web application that consumes the backend service
- The web app makes API calls to the service through Choreo's internal network using organization-level visibility

## Pre-requisites

- Kubernetes cluster with Choreo installed
- The `choreoctl` CLI tool installed
- Docker images:
  - `ghcr.io/choreo-idp/samples/reading-list-service`
  - `ghcr.io/choreo-idp/samples/reading-list-webapp`

## Understand the project structure

- **Default Project**: Contains the Reading List Service
  - Handles data management and business logic
  - Exposed internally to the organization

- **Portal Project**: Contains the Reading List Web Application
  - Provides the user interface
  - Communicates with the service through internal endpoints
  - Configured for server-side rendering

## 1. Deploy the applications

I. First, deploy the `Reading List Service`:

```shell
choreoctl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/main/samples/deploying-applications/use-prebuilt-image/org-visibility/reading-list-service.yaml
```

II. Then, deploy the `Reading List Web Application`:

```shell
choreoctl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/main/samples/deploying-applications/use-prebuilt-image/org-visibility/reading-list-webapp.yaml
```

## 2. Verify the deployment

I. Check the reading list service deployment.

```shell
choreoctl get deployments --organization default-org --project default-project --component reading-list-service
```
II. Check the web application deployment.

```shell
choreoctl get deployments --organization default-org --project portal --component reading-list-webapp
```

## 3. Expose the API gateway locally

Port forward the Choreo gateway service to access it locally.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n choreo-system svc/choreo-external-gateway 8443:443
```

## 4. Access the web application

Access the web application from your browser using the following URL.

```bash
https://reading-list-webapp-development.choreoapps.localhost:8443
```

## 5. Clean Up

To remove all deployed resources, use the following command.

```shell
choreoctl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/main/samples/deploying-applications/use-prebuilt-image/org-visibility/reading-list-service.yaml
choreoctl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choreo-idp/choreo/main/samples/deploying-applications/use-prebuilt-image/org-visibility/reading-list-webapp.yaml
```

## Note

### Organization-Level Service Visibility

The Reading List Service is configured to be visible at the organization level through the following configuration in `book-store-service.yaml`:

```yaml
networkVisibilities:
  public:
    enable: false
  organization:
    enable: true
```

### Internal Service Communication

The web application is configured to communicate with the service using Choreo's internal DNS. This is set up through an environment variable in `book-store-webapp.yaml`:

```yaml
env:
- key: READING_LIST_SERVICE_URL
  value: https://dev.choreoapis.internal/default-project/reading-list-service/api/v1/reading-list
```

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

The web application uses SSR to make API calls from within the cluster, ensuring secure and efficient communication between the frontend and backend services.

## Troubleshoot

- If the web application can't connect to the service, verify:
  - The service deployment is running
  - Organization-level visibility is properly configured
  - The service URL in the webapp's environment variables is correct

- For deployment issues, check the logs:

```shell
choreoctl logs --type=deployment --organization default-org --project default-project --component reading-list-service
choreoctl logs --type=deployment --organization default-org --project portal --component reading-list-webapp
```

This guide provides a clear explanation of the sample's architecture, deployment steps, and key configuration points while maintaining a similar structure to the GitHub Issue Reporter example. It emphasizes the organization-level visibility feature and the internal communication between the applications.
